## Calc.NearestPowerOfTwo (Method)

> **Namespace**: [Heirloom][0]  
> **Declaring Type**: [Calc][1]

### NearestPowerOfTwo(uint)

Computes the nearest power of 2 to a number. This is done by computing both lower and upper power of 2, and then comparing the distance to x.

```cs
public static uint NearestPowerOfTwo(uint x)
```

| Name | Type   | Summary               |
|------|--------|-----------------------|
| x    | `uint` | Some unsigned integer |

> **Returns** - `uint` - The nearest power of 2 to x

### NearestPowerOfTwo(int)

Computes the nearest power of 2 to a number. This is done by computing both lower and upper power of 2, and then comparing the distance to x.

```cs
public static int NearestPowerOfTwo(int x)
```

| Name | Type  | Summary               |
|------|-------|-----------------------|
| x    | `int` | Some unsigned integer |

> **Returns** - `int` - The nearest power of 2 to x
